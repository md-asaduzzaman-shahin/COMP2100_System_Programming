NOTES
Correct output: 1.0 marks.
Your program's output is compared value-by-value with the expected
output.  Any differences in the headings or the values (including
formatting differences) are errors.  The mark is reduced by 0.15 for
each error, up to a maximum of 6 errors when the mark becomes 0.0.

Correct struct definition: 0.9 marks.
The struct definition in your program code is compared with the
correct definition.  Any incorrect member names, or incorrect types,
are counted as errors.  The mark is reduced by 0.15 for each error, up
to a maximum of 6 errors when the mark becomes 0.0.

Correct initialisation of struct: 0.9 marks.
The initialisation of the struct in your program code is checked
carefully.  The values must be formatted as specified in your
initialisation-specification.txt file.  For some initial values, you
are required to perform a conversion such as decimal to hexadecimal as
specified.  The mark is reduced by 0.15 for each error, up to a
maximum of 6 errors when the mark becomes 0.0.

Exit without error in normal usage: 0.2 marks.
Programs should only exit with an error status if they have
encountered an error.  This mark is awarded for programs that exit
correctly.  This is a pass/fail marking item.  Either you are awarded
the maximum mark of 0.2 for satisfying the item, or you are awarded
0.0.

Total mark is out of 3.0.
